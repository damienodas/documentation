  abstract = {Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical signiﬁcance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA’s such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only brieﬂy, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workﬂow.

  abstract  = {This book is a follow-up to the report of Leland Wilkinson and the Task Force on Statistical Inference (TFSI; 1999) of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the fifth edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2001). The goals of this book are to (a) review the now-large literature across many different disciplines about shortcomings of statistical tests; (b) explain why these criticisms have sufficient merit to justify change in data-analysis practices; (c) help readers acquire new skills concerning effect size estimation and interval estimation for effect sizes; and (d) review additional alternatives to statistical tests, including bootstrapping and Bayesian statistics. An additional goal is related to the criticism that the most recent Publication Manual calls for change in data analysis practices but does not give examples. Numerous examples with actual research results are presented throughout this volume. This book is written for researchers and students in psychology and related areas who may not have strong quantitative backgrounds. It assumes that the reader has had at least one undergraduate-level course in behavioral science statistics. Each substantive chapter begins with a review of fundamental statistical issues but does not get into the minutia of statistical theory. Exercises with answers for the chapters are also available on the Web site. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},
